# Hulk

Hulk is a blog focused static site generator, a la [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## Getting Started

Hulk only has a CLI interface right now. In the future it should export its interface so you can `require()` it.

`npm install -g hulk`

**Hulk isn't ready for you yet.** I don't recommend using it unless you are hacking on it.
